ESP32S2:
Works stable.
As expected I can see a the received UDP packages in the Serial output. Using this Android app to send fast frames from a video:
http://udpx.fasani.de
This UDP packages are sent compressed with Brotli and are decompressed in ESP32

S2 vs ESP32 in receive speed
This tests where run with exactly the same Firmware and same settings (outputUdpPacketsInSerial = false so just prints U+first Byte in HEX)

1. 60/70 bytes (Brotli compressed all in the serie)
   S2: AVG framerate 4 Frames per second (FPS)
ESP32: AVG framerate 10 FPS

2. 380/430 bytes 
   S2: AVG framerate 5 FPS
ESP32: AVG framerate 9 FPS

3. 850/1000 bytes
   S2: AVG framerate 3 packets 
ESP32: AVG framerate 6 FPS

Note: The EPS32 in this test is receiving this variable sized compressed frames.
Decompressing and adding one to the frame counter.

CONCLUSION:
