ESP32S2:
Works stable.
As expected I can see a the received UDP packages in the Serial output. Using this Android app to send fast frames from a video:
http://udpx.fasani.de
I'm sending packages of about 2Kb of data using udpx app and sending it using Javascript / UDP in a Cordova App.

S2 vs ESP32 in receive speed

Testing receiving 2Kb of data sent by Android I got 12 Frames per second avg in both Chips. 
I've expected a bit lower framerate in S2 since it has only one Core but for that let's do something more procesor intensive like receive and decompress (Coming in next tests)



Consumption of this test on S2*
100 mA/h Almost constant 100 milliamps per hour, no matter if receiving or not.


Consumption on ESP32
About 85 to 90 mA/h. When receiving from 120 and spikes up to 150 mA/h 

Receiving consumes between 40 to 50% more than with S2 one LX7 core.

*NOTE: measured with 5V USB so is passing through the voltage regulator
