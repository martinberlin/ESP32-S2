ESP32S2
0.79 mA/hour in deepsleep. 
I guess this is the first revision so there is nothing to worry about. 
But is not at moment a board that you want to plug into a 3.7 V battery and make it wake up every hour.

ESP32
On a good ESP32 board like tinyPICO.com itâ€™s 0.08 mA/hour 
That's 10 times less than this S2 version.
